# Taylor Ipsum Generator

The Taylor Ipsum Generator is a Lorem Ipsum generator that uses Taylor Swift lyrics to create placeholder text for your projects. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Fun Fact: Almost all of this code (including this README file) was generated with ChatGPT
