    "taylor_swift": "It\'s strange to think the songs we used to sing\r\nThe smiles, the flowers, everything is gone\r\nYesterday I found out about you\r\nEven now just looking at you\r\nFeels wrong\r\nYou say that you\'d take it all back\r\nGiven one chance, it was a moment of weakness\r\nAnd you said, \"Yes\"\r\n\r\nYou should\'ve said, \"No\"\r\nYou should\'ve gone home\r\nYou should\'ve thought twice \'fore you let it all go\r\nYou should\'ve known that word \'bout what you did with her\r\nGet back to me (get back to me)\r\nAnd I should\'ve been there\r\nIn the back of your mind\r\nI shouldn\'t be asking myself, \"Why?\"\r\nYou shouldn\'t be beggin\' for forgiveness at my feet\r\nYou should\'ve said, \"No\"\r\nBaby, and you might still have me\r\n\r\nYou can see that I\'ve been cryin\'\r\nBaby, you know all the right things\r\nTo say\r\nBut do you honestly expect me to believe\r\nWe could ever be the same?\r\nYou say that the past is the past\r\nYou need one chance, it was a moment of weakness\r\nAnd you said, \"Yes\"",
    "fearless": "You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors\r\nIt\'s the morning of your very first day\r\nYou say \"Hi\" to your friends you ain\'t seen in a while\r\nTry and stay out of everybody\'s way\r\nIt\'s your freshman year and you\'re gonna be here\r\nFor the next four years in this town\r\nHoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\r\n\"You know I haven\'t seen you around before.\"\r\n\r\n\'Cause when you\'re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\r\nYou\'re gonna believe them\r\nAnd when you\'re fifteen\r\nFeeling like there\'s nothing to figure out\r\nWell, count to ten, take it in\r\nThis is life before you know who you\'re gonna be\r\nFifteen\r\n\r\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\r\nAnd soon enough you\'re best friends\r\nLaughing at the other girls who think they\'re so cool\r\nWe\'ll be out of here as soon as we can\r\nAnd then you\'re on your very first date and he\'s got a car\r\nAnd you\'re feeling like flying\r\nAnd your mamma\'s waiting up and you\'re thinking he\'s the one\r\nAnd you\'re dancing \'round your room when the night ends\r\nWhen the night ends",
    "speak_now": "I used to think one day we\'d tell the story of us\r\nHow we met and the sparks flew instantly\r\nAnd people would say, \"They\'re the lucky ones.\"\r\nI used to know my place was the spot next to you\r\nNow I\'m searching the room for an empty seat\r\n\'Cause lately I don\'t even know what page you\'re on\r\n\r\nOh, a simple complication\r\nMiscommunications lead to fall-out\r\nSo many things that I wish you knew\r\nSo many walls up I can\'t break through\r\n\r\nNow I\'m standing alone in a crowded room and we\'re not speaking\r\nAnd I\'m dying to know is it killing you like it\'s killing me, yeah?\r\nI don\'t know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down\r\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now",
    "red": "\'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\r\nWe\'re dancing \'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\r\nDown the stairs, I was there\r\nI remember it all too well\r\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\r\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\r\nSacred prayer and we\'d swear\r\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\r\n\r\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\r\nMaybe I asked for too much\r\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\r\n\'Til you tore it all up\r\nRunning scared, I was there\r\nI remember it all too well\r\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\r\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\r\nI\'m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\r\n\'Cause I remember it all, all, all\r\n\r\nThey say all\'s well that ends well, but I\'m in a new Hell\r\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\r\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\r\nAnd that made me want to die\r\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\r\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\r\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\r\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\r\nThat\'s what happened, you\r\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\r\nSipping coffee like you\'re on a late-night show\r\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\r\nAnd he said, \"It\'s supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"",
    "1989": "The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\r\nWhen the flowers that we\'d grown together died of thirst\r\nIt was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\r\nYou\'re still all over me\r\nLike a wine-stained dress I can\'t wear anymore\r\n\r\nHung my head as I lost the war\r\nAnd the sky turned black like a perfect storm\r\n\r\nRain came pouring down\r\nWhen I was drowning, that\'s when I could finally breathe\r\nAnd by morning\r\nGone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean\r\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)",
    "reputation": "I never trust a narcissist, but they love me\r\nSo I play \'em like a violin\r\nAnd I make it look\u2014oh\u2014so easy\r\n\r\n\'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three\r\nThis is how the world works\r\nNow all he thinks about is me\r\n\r\nI can feel the flames on my skin\r\nCrimson-red paint on my lips\r\nIf a man talks shit\r\nThen I owe him nothing\r\nI don\'t regret it one bit\r\n\'Cause he had it coming",
    "lover": "Combat\r\nI\'m ready for combat\r\nI say I don\'t want that\r\nBut what if I do?\r\n\r\n\'Cause cruelty\r\nWins in the movies\r\nI\'ve got a hundred thrown-out speeches\r\nI almost said to you\r\n\r\nEasy they come\r\nEasy they go\r\nI jump from the train\r\nI ride off alone\r\nI never grew up\r\nIt\'s getting so old\r\nHelp me hold on to you",
    "folklore": "They told me all of my cages were mental\r\nSo I got wasted like all my potential\r\nAnd my words shoot to kill when I\'m mad\r\nI have a lot of regrets about that\r\nI was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere\r\nFell behind all my classmates and I ended up here\r\nPourin\' out my heart to a stranger\r\nBut I didn\'t pour the whiskey\r\n\r\nI just wanted you to know\r\nThat this is me trying\r\nI just wanted you to know\r\nThat this is me trying\r\n\r\nAt least I\'m trying",
    "evermore": "How\'s one to know?\r\nI\'d meet you where the spirit meets the bones\r\nIn a faith-forgotten land\r\nIn from the snow\r\nYour touch brought forth an incandescent glow\r\nTarnished but so grand\r\n\r\nAnd the old widow goes to the stone every day\r\nBut I don\'t, I just sit here and wait\r\nGrieving for the living\r\n\r\nOh, goddamn\r\nMy pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand\r\nTaking mine, but it\'s been promised to another\r\nOh, I can\'t\r\nStop you putting roots in my dreamland\r\nMy house of stone, your ivy grows\r\nAnd now I\'m covered in you",
    "midnights": "Summer went away\r\nStill the yearning stays\r\nI play it cool with the best of them\r\nI wait patiently\r\nHe\'s gonna notice me\r\nIt\'s okay, we\'re the best of friends\r\nAnyway\r\n\r\nI hear it in your voice\r\nYou\'re smoking with your boys\r\nI touch my phone as if it\'s your face\r\nI didn\'t choose this town\r\nI dream of getting out\r\nThere\'s just one who could make me stay\r\nAll my days\r\n\r\nFrom sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\r\nI waited ages to see you there\r\nI search the party of better bodies\r\nJust to learn that you never cared\r\nYou\'re on your own, kid\r\nYou always have been"
